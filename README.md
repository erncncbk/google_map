Sample Flutter project to demonstrate how to integrate Google map and drawing polyline between source and destination location.

## Getting Started

-   For the map to work you should add Google Maps API key in the following files.

        -   ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift (add the API Key and import the Google Maps Reference)
        -   ios/Runner/Info.plist (add the missing permissions)

    -   Under the android folder:
        -   android/app.src/main/AndroidManifest.xml (add the API Key entry and permissions)


-   pubspec.yaml: 
    -   install the google_maps_flutter dependency for use google_maps
